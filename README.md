# Why is this project useful?
This project is useful for people who want to get into weight lifting and people who are already lifting weights.<br>
For example, if you want to start weightlifting but don't know where to start, you can get help from watching how-to videos and trying out a beginner routine.<br>
Or if you have been lifting but you are struggling to increase your weights, you can find out what level you are in by using level calculator and try out different routines based on your level!
